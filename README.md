# ArrayJscriptPractise
This Project is moreover a personal project practising in the Arrays, In this project there are 4 function that we can invoke for different purpose i.e. finding max value among the elements of an array, reversing the element of an array and so on.
In this Project I learnt

1. to use "for loop" to loop over the element of an Array.
2. to create function and using business logic in more productive way.
